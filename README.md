## Usage

This demo will rebalance your Alpaca paper account holdings to approximate the portfolio weights specified in the `model.yaml` file. 

You can fork this repo and try it out with your own Alpaca account. You'll need to add the repository secrets listed in the workflow file to your own repo. Make sure your actions are enabled, and then run the workflow.
